## Source code for a Portfolio Project.

The movie trailer website shows the trailer of different movies that are created. By clicking on
the poster image, you can view their trailers.

This project showcases the skills I have learnt in the HTML, CSS courses with responsiveness.

## Files



* `index.html` -- The file which is where HTML is situated.
* `styles.css` -- General CSS for the HTML and desktop.
* `tablet.css` -- CSS for responsiveness on tablets.
* `phone.css` -- CSS for phones.

## Usage

1. Open the index.html in the browser.
2. For better experience please stay connected to the Internet, as I have a link to Google Fonts..
